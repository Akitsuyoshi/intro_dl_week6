# DL model to forecast store sales data in Ecuador

This is my 6th week assignment in CU Boulder intro deep learning class.

We apply entity embedding to make it easy for DL model to learn categorical data.

We assume this notebook runs on kaggle notebook. The original kaggle competision is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting). You can get the same dataset as we use from competition page.

### Files and Folders
* [tabular_dl.ipynb](./tabular_dl.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the data analysis and model building code

### Prerequisite

* Kaggle account
* Dataset. downloadable from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/data)
